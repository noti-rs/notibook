# Layout Basics

Layouts in `Noti` are built using **widgets** and **type values**:

## Widgets

Widgets are the building blocks of layouts. They are graphic elements with customizable properties. The available widgets are:

- **FlexContainer**: A container that organizes its child widgets.
- **Text**: Displays text, such as the summary or body.
- **Image**: Displays an image.

## Type Values

Type values are configuration options used to adjust widget behavior. Examples include:

- **[Alignment](#alignment)**: Controls horizontal and vertical alignment.
- **[Spacing](#spacing)**: Defines padding or margins.
- **[Border](./ConfigProperties#Border)**: Adds a border around widgets.
